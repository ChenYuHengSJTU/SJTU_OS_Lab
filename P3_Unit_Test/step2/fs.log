[34mw file1 1000 Alan Turing was a British mathematician and logician who is widely regarded as the father of modern computer science. During World War II, he played a crucial role in cracking German encryption codes, which helped to bring an end to the war. In 1950, he proposed what is now known as the Turing Test, which tests a machine's ability to exhibit intelligent behavior equivalent to, or indistinguishable from, that of a human. This work laid the foundation for the field of artificial intelligence. Sadly, Turing was persecuted for being gay and convicted of homosexuality in 1952. He died of apparent suicide two years later. It was only in 2009 that British Prime Minister Gordon Brown issued a public apology on behalf of the British government for the way Turing was treated.
